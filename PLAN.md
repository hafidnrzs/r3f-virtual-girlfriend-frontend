- [ ] Test sending and receiving messages from LiveKit
- [ ] Integrate unified chat and transcription display using a custom hook
- [ ] Handle LiveKit room events and errors in the UI (disconnect, media device errors)
- [ ] Ensure message sending uses LiveKitâ€™s chat context
- [ ] Create RPC to toggle the visibility and image of the `IllustrationPanel` component
- [ ] Implement RPC via data channel for sending animation and facialExpression changes
- [ ] Integrate RPC with frontend and update state accordingly
